## Hi, I'm Holly.<br>
I'm just starting out on my journey with [School of Code](https://schoolofcode.co.uk/), making my first steps towards a career in tech.
Loving *every* aspect of coding so far and excited to push myself further.

When I'm not learning I'm usually immersed in an audio book, cuddling a cat 🐈‍⬛ or playing computer games.
