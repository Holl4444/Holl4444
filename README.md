## Hi, I'm Holly.<br>
I'm just completed my journey with [School of Code](https://schoolofcode.co.uk/) and am making my first steps towards a career in tech.
The areas I've encountered that most excited my interest were UX and AI but I'm loving *every* aspect of coding so far and excited to push myself further. 

When I'm not learning I'm usually immersed in an audio book, cuddling a cat 🐈‍⬛ or playing computer games.
